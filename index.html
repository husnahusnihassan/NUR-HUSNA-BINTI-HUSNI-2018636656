<h4 style="text-align:center"> Some Thoughts </h4> 
<p align="right"> "They don't know what you are going through, even if they pretend to. Your struggles, your pain and all your darkest moments are your own. People might act like they care but the truth is they don't; especially when you face the hardest circumstances of life, when you are down and broken on the inside, when you are struggling to find hope and ligh. It is in those moments of your journey of life you will get to meet the people who are meant for you, love you and wants to be there for you. You will also get to realize that no matter what happens, you will have your own self always by your side"</p>
