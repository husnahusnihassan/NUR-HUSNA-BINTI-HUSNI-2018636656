<img src="experience/uss.jpg" width="20%" height="60%" align="right"><font size="5">I recently went to Singapore for the 2nd time with my sister. Also, this was our 2nd sister's trip and actually i haven't finished my final exam for my 2nd semester yet during that time. I went there during the 12 days of gap for the last paper. Ok anyway, I have to travel from AOR to JHB first because we will be going to Singapore from Johor. We went to Singapore for a day only because the plan was going to Universal Studios. this adventurous trip included my sister's friends, kak aishah, angah (kak aishah's sister) and kak fatt. I will share about the scary rides only (based on my opinion) in this entry. Happy reading!
<br>
<p>We arrived USS at 10am on Tuesday and spent the whole day there. Our first ride was "Transformers the ultimate 3D battle" . We need to queue for about more than an hour but it's so worth it!! we became a freedom fighter that helps Bumblebee and Optimus Prime to fight Megatron. it was like we enter the transformers world that needs to race through the city. riding an autobot with 3D spec gave extra feelings like facing the real situation of battles.</p>
<br>
<p> The most adventurous one!! "Battlestar galactica: Human". My sister and I only ride the Human one (red track) not the Cyclon (grey track). My sister and I screamed so loud and I even cried but it was worth to try since we were already here although I'm afraid of heights . This was the most risky decision that I have ever made. I totally forgot about all the problems while riding the roller coaster.</p>

<img src="experience/gardens.jpg" width="30%" height="60%" align="left"><font size="5"><p> Let's continue from my previous post. There's nothing much for this entry actually but yeah. We slept at the homestay for about an hour before going to Gardens By The Bay at Marina Gardens. As usual, we took the MRT and stopped at the Bayfront station and took a bus straight to the garden.</p>
<br>
<p>There were few sections of entry such as flower dome, cloud forest that we explored. We first entered the flower dome, there were so many fresh flowers in there like omg that was sooo cool because I really like flowers. But there were so many people in there which made the space was quite limited to walk through.</p>
<br>
<p>Then we entered the cloud forest, the indoor temperature was around 23 to 25dc and I really love the weather in there. We went to the highest level of the waterfall mountain which was wrapped with plants and flowers. I am soooo amazed because everything was real plants.</p>
